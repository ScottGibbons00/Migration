# Migration

Hi everyone! You can reach the site at [climate-fiction-migration.netlify.app](https://climate-fiction-migration.netlify.app/). This is where all of the html/css is that actually creates the website.
You can look at the html (which basically lists everything on the screen) in the file called index.html. You can look at the css (which styles everyting) in styles.css.
