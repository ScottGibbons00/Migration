                <h2>The movement of a person or people from one country, locality, place of residence, etc., to settle in another</h2>
                <p>Although forced migration because of climate change has yet to peak, its effects are 
                    felt in many ecosystems. As we continue to slip into apocolypse, climate change will move humans.
                    In many cases, minorities will be foreced to move first. Without change, millions, perhaps billions, of people
                    will have no choice to move. "Migration" explores the setting of these examples of movement, and shows the systems
                    that support environmental injustice.

                Eventually, however, people will have no choice but to move inland. Hundreds of years of 
            racism have resulted in unequal geographies, where minorities are in more danger than white people.
            Coastal counties have proprotionally more African Americans. These geological differences will force
            more inequalities as these African Americans are forced to migrate.

                    <p>Examples of <span style="color: red">slow violence</span>, such as deforestion, have shown to drive long-term migration. Deforestation destroys ecosystems and biodiversity, which effects nearby communities. </p>

                <li>
                    <p>In certain regions, deforestation disrupts the water cycle, removes the mesh that hold soil in place, and eliminates nutrients.
                        This causes <span style="color: red">desertification</span>, and prevents people from living or farming on previously healthy land.

                <h2>Take the example of The Marathon Petroleum Corporation&apos;s Oil Refinery in Boynton, Michigan</h2>
                <p> This oil refinery is situated in a town that is 75% African American, and causes thousands to become sick.
                    Nearby in Detroit, there are twice as many deaths from air pollution as gun violence, and the 
                    &quot;impacts of poor air quality disproportionately fall on poor and minority populations.&quot; Many left if they could afford to leave.
                    When the refinery expanded, Marathon bought the houses of a white community nearby to mitigate the effects of 
                    their pollution on the community. Meanwhile, the predominantly black communtiy of Boynton was not offered
                    any buyout opportunities. While some were given the opporunity to migrate with financial support,
                    minorities were either forced to migrate or suffer through health conditions.
